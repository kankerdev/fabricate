description = "This mod catches injection exceptions when two mixins conflict. It finds the culprits and displays a user-friendly GUI, explaining the problem and providing buttons to report the issue to the mod's issues page. This mod is opt-in as you don't need it to play the game, it doesn't fix anything but just happens to provide useful information on why your game may not start. This may be useful to enable if your game doesn't start when you happened to have added your own mods to the game. This mod should be enabled before sending a bug-report to the modpack maintainer."
