description = "An open-source shaders mod compatible with OptiFine shaderpacks. This mod isn't necessary to be included with the game so it is opt-in, enabling this mod will provide you a way to play the game with shaders. I technically won't support this when other mods conflict and things like Create contraptions might become visually buggy with shaders enabled but if you want to try playing with these, enable this and you should be able to play with shaders. Use with caution!"
