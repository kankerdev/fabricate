description = "Nvidium is a replacement rendering backend for sodium that uses nvidia only opengl extensions to increase fps by a significant amount. This mod requires an NVIDIA GPU that supports mesh shaders. This feature was introduced in turing architecture, anything that is a 16xx series or newer (20xx series also works) that supports mesh shaders. This mod will do nothing when these requirements aren't met so this isn't included by default. Performance impact varies but should be positive. Not compatible with Bobby but provides similar functionality.."
