description = "Bobby is a Minecraft mod which allows for render distances greater than the server's view-distance setting. It does not load chunks out beyond the server's render distance, it just keeps them within memory allowing you to keep seeing them even when the server doesn't load them. This mod is optional in an opt-out fashion as it is incompatible with mods like Nvidium, VulkanMod and Vulkanite and should be disabled if you prefer these over Bobby."
