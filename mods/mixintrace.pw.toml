description = "This is a Fabric mod that adds a list of mixins (and Mixin configuration names) to classes in the stack trace to crash reports. This mod is opt-in as you don't need it to play the game, it doesn't fix anything but just happens to be useful information when you have issues with your game and would like to make a bug report and give it to the modpack maintainer."
